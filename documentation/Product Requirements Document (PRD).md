- Ensure security compliance with PIPEDA and HIPAA standards
- Offer accessible, senior-friendly user interface
- Provide customer support through integrated chat functionality
- Manage subscription-based access to digital services

Key technical components include:

- React frontend with Material UI
- Python/Node.js backend
- PostgreSQL database
- AWS S3 storage
- Integrations with Auth0, Shopify, SendGrid, Intercom, and Sanity.io

Out of scope:

- Legal advice or document preparation
